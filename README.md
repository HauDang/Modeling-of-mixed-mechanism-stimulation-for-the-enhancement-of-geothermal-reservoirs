# Modeling of mixed-mechanism stimulation for the enhancement of geothermal reservoirs

This code implements examples of the submitted paper:

H Dang-Trung, E Keilegavlen, I Berre. Modeling of mixed-mechanism stimulation for the enhancement of geothermal reservoirs

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and
innovation programme (grant agreement No 101002507)

Highlights:
•	A numerical model is developed that accounts for coupled hydromechanical processes during mixed-mechanism stimulation of fractured reservoirs.
•	The model includes fracture shear dilation, propagation, and coalescence.
•	The impacts of various factors, such as the stress regime, permeability, and injection rate, on the extension of fracture networks are investigated.


To run the examples contained in this repository a working version of PorePy (Version 1.3.0) must be installed on the computer.
The PorePy install requires installations of further packages, see Install instructions in the PorePy repository.
